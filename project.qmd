## Introduction
Our project leveraged Big Data tools and AWS infrastructure to analyze airline-related tweets. The goal was to derive actionable insights from customer sentiment and complaints, enhancing airlines' operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
---

## Innovative Features

- **AWS Infrastructure Utilization:** Employed Amazon Web Services like S3 for data storage and EMR (Elastic MapReduce) for powerful data processing capabilities.
- **Advanced Data Cleaning Techniques:** Developed a Python script to efficiently clean and consolidate the Twitter_Airline Dataset, ensuring high-quality data for analysis.
- **Complex Data Analysis Tasks:** Executed multiple analytical tasks, including:
  - Determining the number of delayed flights.
  - Categorizing complaints by reasons and airlines.
  - Performing sentiment analysis using SentiWordNet and a CNN model for accuracy comparison.
---

## Key Findings

- **Delayed Flights and Complaint Analysis:** Identified significant patterns in delayed flights and top complaints across different airlines, providing a clear picture of areas needing improvement.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilized SentiWordNet and a CNN model to analyze tweet sentiments, with the CNN model showing remarkable accuracy due to its ability to handle complex linguistic patterns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted comprehensive EDA to explore mentions of airlines, popular hashtags, and geographical distribution of tweets. This provided insights into public sentiment and geographical trends in customer satisfaction.
